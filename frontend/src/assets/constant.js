  I am a passionate software developer who loves coding and solving problems. I enjoy the process of learning new technologies and finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is 
  Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, React, and DBMS. I am also familiar with C# and .NET. I am always looking to learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer.
  When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and meeting with my friends. I also enjoy traveling around the world. I am currently learning about how I can trip around all of the world.
